'''DRUM MACHINE PROJECT'''

The Drum Machine implemented has following features:
* Play & stop controls.
* The ability for the user to alter the tempo of the sequence. However, since I do not have a background in music and was not able to understand the right formular to calculate the interval using the BPM value, so I could not implement it completely.
* Playback readout - there is a visual indication of the active step while the sequence is playing. Ideally, the playback speed will also match the sequence tempo.
* There are 3 premade drum pattern sequences that can be loaded into your drumkit.
* The pattern is expected to be 8 steps or more. I am not sure why would we need to check steps in premade sequence.
